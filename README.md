## Visualizations

The visualizations were created using Mapbox GL JS to render interactive data visualizations representing the green-view and sky-view ratios of street view imagery. Additionally, a blue-color gradient basemap illustrates the median household income, allowing for a comparative analysis with the 
street view image perceptions.

## Correlation Analysis

Included in the project is a comprehensive correlation analysis of computer vision metrics derived from the street view imagery. This analysis provides valuable insights into how visual elements of urban areas correlate with economic indicators.

## Technologies Used

- Mapbox GL JS
- Python for data processing
- GeoJSON for spatial data representation

## How to Use

1. Navigate through the interactive maps to see the distribution of green-view and sky-view ratios.
2. Click on individual street points to get detailed information about each location's ratios.
3. Analyze the correlation between visual metrics and median household income.

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Using command prompt to turn on localhost to read through repository since the html has javascript codes.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the project.
